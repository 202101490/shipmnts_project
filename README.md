# Chess App

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** Vimal Songara

## Description

This chess game application is built using React. It offers a classic strategy game experience with a unique twist: the introduction of a new character, the Archer. The Archer replaces one of the Bishops on the board. On its first move, the Archer behaves like a Bishop, and on its second move, it acts as a Rook. This alternating behavior continues throughout the game, adding an exciting layer of strategy.

Enjoy challenging your friends with this innovative take on the traditional chess game!
